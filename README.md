The requirements that were present in hand demanded for a continent application that overcame the excessive iterative processes that were mandatory for the testing if the object files etc. This growing demand gave rise to the idea of the application as this would save up on a lot of work hours and skip multiple iterative processes.

The designing phase of the application was done in an Agile environment and the progress was monitored during the daily sprints. There was ample amount of time that was given to the designing phase of the application and that has been working well for us at the moment.  

One of The main task was for connecting X environment OS to the host UNIX environment and then carry out the actions that then eliminate the multiple iterative processes. Then came front end development using Angular and Back end development using Java and Spring Boot. These tech stacks were all new to me and this project work really broadened my horizons and has made me a much more valuable asset to any company as a Software Developer.

I have written multiple scripts that have worked around the existing steps that the employees are following that when calculated, save upto 30 minutes of time to upto 4 hours of time that has now been reduced to a mere 1-5 minutes hence saving us N x 1hr of time on average where N is the number of employees performing the similar tasks.
